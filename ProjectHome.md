GWT is great!!!

Getting a third-party Java library to work can be challenging.
This project will hopefully make this easier, by being a place to share GWT modules, super-source, custom serializes,  build files and anything else needed to get a library to work in client side code.

Hopefully the code here with be adopted back into their original projects.

The core of a GWT application or library is the module definition file. Each 3rd party library will require at least one of these and is a good place to start if you are looking to understand what has be gwtified.
